# AI Healthcare Monitoring System

A real-time healthcare monitoring system that uses advanced AI/ML techniques to track, analyze, and predict patient vital signs.

## Overview

This application demonstrates how artificial intelligence and machine learning can be integrated into healthcare monitoring to improve patient outcomes. The system continuously tracks vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, and ECG data, using AI algorithms to analyze these metrics, detect abnormalities, and provide immediate alerts to healthcare professionals.



## Features

- **Real-time Vital Signs Monitoring**: Continuous tracking of heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, temperature, and ECG
- **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection**: Using Isolation Forest algorithm to identify unusual patterns in vital signs
- **Predictive Modeling**: Time-series forecasting to predict future vital sign values
- **Health Risk Assessment**: Multi-factor risk calculation analyzing relationships between different vital signs
- **ECG Pattern Analysis**: Advanced visualization and classification of cardiac rhythms
- **Explainable AI**: Detailed explanations of AI-generated risk assessments with feature importance visualization
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Review patient data over time with statistical analysis and AI-generated insights
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjustable alert thresholds and AI model parameters

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **AI/ML**: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Real-time Communication**: Flask-SocketIO
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js
